## Problem Statement

As students, all of us are lazy. Due to immense distances between the hostels and the stores, it is often difficult to get things from various places in the campus. We often find it hard to reach out to friends who might be in the vicinity of the respective store in order to source the item and these actions require a lot of effort.

This project makes it possible to connect with students who are in the particular store in order to procure the items required.

- Students view all the available requests on the portal and decide if they want to accept it
- Students post requests on the website for the required store and the time buffer which is available.
- Students can see and fulfill the pending requests on the portal.
- Students who posted the request can update the status as successful or failed on the portal.
- Students who fail to deliver the items will be reported to the administrators.
- Students will earn Karma points upon fulfilling the requests.
- Students can redeem Karma points to prioritize their request on the portal and they stay higher on the post-board for the particular day.
- Administrators will be able to see reports against other students and on the basis of the report they can penalize the student.
